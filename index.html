                                Then my admission in Apeejay leaving other better schools behind. Well, there are a lot of coincidences I guess to make me meet you. 
                                Class 8 would be the luckiest year of my entire school journey for sure. 
                                My luck doesn't shine very often but when it does... it outshines the sun and you're my evidence for it.</p>

                            <p>The entire school life, after multiple proposals and rejecting them all, you somehow found him interesting, somehow thought that he is the one... Your Forever. I knew that he's not for you, that it wouldn't last long and it didn't. You were crying like anything on the heartbreak and I couldn't handle it. But I didn't know that helping you with the situation at that point will lead us to what we have right now. Never thought that I'll find the one made for me like this. It was beautiful.</p>

So, took out the time for a conversation even on the busiest of my days when I studied 14-15 hrs a day. 
                                I wanted to stay connected, I knew you were special to me, so when everbody was leaving, I stood there holding your hands, believing in you and me.... all as a part of GOD's plan I guess. So that I can love You!</p>

The question of whether I love you or not left me speechless, I didn't know, never thought about it. And I didn't want to make the wrong decision, can't risk you crying again. 
                                After thinking about it for long under pressure, I knew I loved you, and it was only you. I finally confessed my feelings for you after holding it in for 3 years.</p>

                            Saw you smiling, laughing and heard your sweet voice... a melody which brings peace to my heart and satisfies my soul. I specifically remember each and every detail, the day, the way you entered the cafe. 
                            The things we talked about and the dishes we ordered, including the 2 cappucino ready on the table as you said the night before ;) <br>I couldn't stop smiling for a second during the entire time.</p>

                                So I thought of expressing myself again and nicely this time with carefully chosen words that can best express what I have for you in my heart for years now. <br>I Love you and I want you as my partner, I want to protect you, take care of you, cherish you, pamper you and love you for as long as I am.</p>

                                I woke up to a beautiful text from you containing 7 paragraphs and your emotions with it. 
                                It was so heartfelt and so deep, I couldn't help but drown in your love. 
                                Every little effort from your side assures me that I've made the right choice in choosing you again and again over everybody else and loving you so hard.
